THE BUSINESS QUESTIONS 

These business questions cover the sales, operations and strategy aspects. By analyzing the datasets, FurniSmart Solutions can gain insights and make data-driven decisions to improve their overall performance and competitiveness.

- **In which month of the year did the company generated the highest profit?**
  
According the analysis, The table presents a monthly summary of sales and profit data. November and December stand out as peak sales months, with  $352,461.07 and $325,293.50 in sales, respectively. December records the highest profit of $43,369.19, likely due to holiday such as Christmas which often lead to increased consumer spending. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between sales and profit, where higher sales generally result in higher profits. While February has the lowest sales, it still boasts a relatively high profit of $10,294.61, suggesting efficient cost management. This data emphasized the importance of capitalizing on peak sales months and implementing strategies to maintain profitability throughout the year.

- **Which Segment and City has the highest and lowest revenue?**

This metric serves as a critical evaluation of the top revenue-generating cities in contrast to those cities that contribute the least revenue. 
The top three cities leading in revenue generation are identified as New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle, with the Consumer segment notably contributing the most revenue. As a Data Analyst, I strongly recommend that these top three cities consider increasing their supply to meet the high demand in these areas. By doing so, they can optimize their profit potential and enhance their market presence.

On the other end of the spectrum, the least revenue-generating cities include San Antonio, Houston and Philadelphia. Based on the data analysis, I propose the strategic closure of sales outlets in cities where the sales revenue falls below the $100 mark. This recommendation stems from the observation that the majority of these outlets are operating at a loss, and the profits generated are insufficient to cover the associated overhead costs. By implementing this course of action, the business can redirect resources to more profitable regions and strengthen its overall financial health.

**What are the best performing and least performing products by category?** 

This analysis focuses on identifying the best and worst-performing products within each category. By evaluating sales, profit, and other relevant metrics, it aims to uncover the products that excel in their respective categories and those that may require improvement. The findings can guide strategic decisions, such as optimizing the marketing or inventory management of top-performing products and exploring ways to enhance the performance of those in underperforming categories. This insight-driven approach will empower FurniSmart Solutions to allocate resources more efficiently and strengthen their product portfolio for improved overall performance.

Among the products, the Canon Image copier emerges as the top-performer, demonstrating a remarkable performance with impressive earnings of $25,199.93. In stark contrast, the least performing product is the Cubify Cubex 3D printer, unfortunately incurring the highest loss of $8,878.97. These findings underscore the significance of focusing on products with exceptional performance while addressing areas of concern to optimize profitability.

However, Chromecraft conference table and based recorded huge loss to the tune of $2,876.12.

From the analysis, out of 9994 products, 304 products are in negative positions and should be discontinued. 

Furthermore, It is highly recommended that the budgets apportioned to the loss making products, should be redirected to the best performing products.
